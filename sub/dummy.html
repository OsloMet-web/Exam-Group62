               <h2>What is big data?</h2>
               <p>
                 Big data refers to the vast and complex volume of structured and unstructured data that organizations accumulate from various sources, such as social media, 
                 sensors, databases, and more. This data is characterized by its three Vs: volume (large amounts of data), velocity (rapid data generation and processing), 
                 and variety (diverse data types). Big data has the potential to provide valuable insights and support decision-making in fields ranging from business and 
                 healthcare to scientific research and government. To harness the power of big data, organizations use advanced technologies and analytics to extract 
                 meaningful patterns, trends, and knowledge from this wealth of information, driving innovation and improved decision-making.
               </p>
               <p>
                 In addition to the three Vs, there is a fourth V: veracity, and a fifth V which is value. Extracting value from big data is a crucial goal for organizations. 
                 By analyzing and interpreting the vast amounts of data they collect, businesses can gain valuable insights into customer behavior, market trends, and operational 
                 efficiencies, enabling them to make data-informed decisions. Furthermore, big data analytics can be used for predictive modeling, helping organizations anticipate 
                 future trends and challenges.

               <h2>An introduction to AI</h2>
               <p>
                 AI is one of the fastest growing technologies in the world right now. It is the basis of striking technologies, from computers that can read letters, websites
                 that can make recommendations to voice assistance in your phone, self-driving cars etc. AI has the potential power to revolutionize the way we live our lives.
                 AI is the field of study that attempts to make machines think and behave intelligently. Usually that means to mimic some cognitive functions like learning, 
                 perception, decision making or problem solving. To act intelligently, a machine needs to be able to do several things, and Ai needs to be able to:

                   <ul>
                      <li>Sense the world around itself.</li>
                      <li>Extract meaning from the data it collects.</li>
                      <li>Learn from experience so it can connect facts and generate knowledge and predictions.</li>
                      <li>Use its understanding to take actions that are proper to the context and effective to solve problems</li>
                      <li>Talk to us through language.</li>
                   </ul>
               </nav>
               <p>
                 Each of these abilities is challenging itself and represents a subfield of a specialization in AI: pattern recognition to discover regularities in the data,
                 computer vision to extract information from videos and images, speech recognition to convert sounds into relevant information like words, natural language 
                 processing to allow the machine to use human natural language and understand grammatically correct sentences and produce them. Finally, there is the field 
                 of robotics that allows machines to solve problems in the physical world. As you can imagine, AI is dependent on information or data. The more data a 
                 computer has available, the more experiences and examples it can learn from.
