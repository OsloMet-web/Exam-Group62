            <p class="author"> <em>Per Pedersen- 11/15/2023 </em>, 7:30 PM</p>
            <p class="item"> Society has become more digitalized now more than ever, a lot of the things that happen in our society 
                happens through the internet. It can be everything from working at your computer to talking with your 
                family back home.

            <p class="item"> In other rural areas where internet cables may be hard to set up, satellites would
                give them easier access to internet. Setting up satellite internet is more expensive 
                <a href="https://ts2.space/en/the-pros-and-cons-of-satellite-internet-is-it-right-for-you/">according to TS2</a>.
                 Maintenance, plans and installations. It also have latency issues since it has to travel a great distance.

            <h2 class="item"> Potentional impact of satellite internet technology could have on the society </h2>
            <p class="item"> An unintended consequence is an unwanted accumulation of space garbage in space. 
                In addition, the satellite internet could impact wildlife such as animal habitats. 
                The losers are therefore the animals who do not have a say, or anyone to speak their word. </p>
            <p class="item"> Satellite internet will benefit people that are not able to connect to and use fiber internet.
                It has a wide range that will reach to big areas where its hard to use the traditional fiber internet.</p>
        
            <p class="item"> Those that benefit the from this technology the most are people that live in more remote areas.
                 However, satellites can’t reach all remote areas where there’s a lot of surroundings such as a forest or a deep canyon. 
                 Most people that live in cities would rather have internet cables, 
                because of how cheap and fast it is compared to people that live in remote areas. </p>
        
            <p class="item"> There are economic consequences linked to satellite internet, 
                such as the cost of expanding the satellite internet to rural areas, the cost of launching the satellites in space 
                and the fact that it will cost more for the individual consumer to use satellite internet. </p>
        
            <p class="item"> Satellite could be dangerous for national security since data breaches is more likely to happen. Solution to this would be if leaders would not think about the country’s gain, 
                rather they should think about what we gain as the human race.</p>

                <ol class="item2">
                    <li class="list"> Internet will be more accessible throughout 
                        the world and will have a wider range, especially when it comes to more rural areas. </li>
                    <li class="list"> There would be less sabotages done to the physical cables</li>
                    <li class="list">Less maintaining of the physical cables, and there will be less material spent on producing these </li>

                <ol class="item4">
                    <li class="list">Higher latency that is inconsistent. The reason for this is because of the distance 
                        it has to travel. It could also be interrupted by weather. </li>
                    <li class="list">Expensive: Satellites are more expensive in comparison to physical cables. </li>
                    <li class="list">Satellites are also the worst out of the two when it comes to the environment, 
                    especially for the ozone layer because of the rocket fuel that is used for getting them up in space.  </li>

            <h2 class="my-opinion item"> My opinions regarding the topic </h2>
            <p class="item"> 
            There are two sides to this case, on one side it may benefit some societies better.
            Especially in areas that are remote, where it can be hard to set up internet cables. 
            In addition, satellite internet will be more resilient during a natural disaster, 
            and can be recovered more quickly. 
            </p>
            <p class="item">
            This way they will be able to use it freely, 
            but changing everything from fiber to satellite can be problematic because satellite internet
            could potentially be more expensive and causing more harm to the environment. 
            </p>
            <p class="item">
            By launching an extensive amount of satellites, the more damage it causes to earth's ozone layer.
            Rocket fuel emits big amounts of CO2 which further affects earth's temperature. 
            Satellite also has higher latency which makes websites and videos load slower than what we are used to with fiber according to TS2.
