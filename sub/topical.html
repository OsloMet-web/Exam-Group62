            <p class="paragraph-intro-smartcity">
            Smart city initiatives do not limit themselves to improving 
            the efficiency of existing cities, but also aim to build completely new cities
            and neighborhoods. In 2016 Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Google/Alphabet,
            proposed to build a completely new part of Toronto with smart city technology from the ground up.
            A steady stream of proposed smart city initiatives, such as Net City (China), Telosa (U.S), 
            The Line (Saudi Arabia), arguably demonstrate the ambition to integrate digital
            technology into the city and bridge the gap between the virtual and the physical realms.   
            </p>

            <p> 
                Case:
Imagine that Sidewalk Labs have delivered a proposal to build a completely new neighborhood at Grønlikaia in Oslo. The proposal includes 2000 new apartments, shops, restaurants, and connection to the Oslo
transit system all supported by the world’s most advanced IoT software, sensors, and machine learning algorithms.
The neighborhood will only include rental apartments, priced well below the average price in Oslo, but you will need to sign terms and conditions allowing personal data to be collected by Sidewalk Labs.

Your group of experts have been asked to evaluate this proposal and provide a response to Oslo City Council. Use the form below to guide and summarize your discussions.

        <h1> Why you should live in a smart city</h1>
            <!-- a general paragraph to have the same css style-->
            <p> Its technological advancement. Introducing IoT technology, sensors and machine learning can lead to improved efficiency, 
                managing resources and improved quality in the neighborhood.</p>
            
            <p> Its affordabilty. Rental prices below the average prices could potentially 
                make it more accessible for a wider range of residents. </p>

            <p> Connecting the neighborhood to the transportation system in Oslo will make it more efficient moving around. 
                It will also reduce the use of private vehicles which directly reduce the emission of carbon dioxide.  </p>

        <h1> Why you should not live in a smart city</h1> 

            <p> Its exploitability. 1.	Exploitability in regards to giving away personal information to a private company. 
                 They would not necessarily always have the customers best interests in mind.</p>

            <p> Its survelliance. 2.	As technology is always evolving at a rapid pace, a smart city will 
                be in need of constant surveillance and updates to make sure things run smoothly. As things become more digital and complex, 
                simple and manual solutions will become less effective in case things break down. </p>
